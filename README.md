Capstone Project

In this application you can expect to get some useful information about
building computers.

I have tried to set this out somewhat like the book example that we all ran through early last week,
 I'm hoping to be able to just grab information about a computer when requested.
In the end I want the user to be able to choose a computer from the options given then have a list of computers
corresponding with the users selection.

Part B
added to application.properties(server port to 8081)
with help, rearranged code and error fixed
application runs and has h2 access.
added a new computer to the h2 database(low end PC, all components been low end)
